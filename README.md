# Diamonds
Diamonds is a single player game. Get required number of points and unlock next levels.</br>
I did it with the help of the udemy [courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/programowanie-obiektowe-w-javascript/). I added my own solutions to this game.</br>
Enjoy the game!

## How to play?
Line up three diamonds in a one line to score points.

## My solutions 
I added some code improvements and fixed bugs. I add my own swap speed controller, now you can change speed of swapping diamonds.
